# Authentication Module - FreelanceSphere Backend

This documentation explains the **Authentication System** of the FreelanceSphere project in a **simple and beginner-friendly** way. It’s structured to help any developer (beginner or advanced) understand how registration and login are implemented securely using **Spring Boot**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.

## Project Stack Overview

* **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud DB)
* **Authentication**: JWT (Token-based Auth)
* **Password Hashing**: BCrypt (Industry Standard)
* **Logging**: Spring’s built-in logger

---

## Authentication Flow Summary

```
Frontend -> /register (POST) -> Save new user in MongoDB with hashed password
Frontend -> /login (POST) -> Validate password & generate JWT token
```

User credentials never get stored in plain text. Instead:

* Passwords are **hashed** (not encrypted) using BCrypt.
* JWT token is generated only after successful login.

---

## Register API

### Endpoint

```
POST /api/auth/register
```

### What does it do?

This endpoint creates a new user in the MongoDB database.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "username": "bhakti",
  "email": "bhakti@example.com",
  "password": "secure123"
}
```

### Behind the scenes

* Validates data.
* Hashes the password using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.
* Saves user to MongoDB using Spring Data Repository.

### Response (Success)

```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully"
}
```

### Common Errors

* `409 Conflict`: Email already exists
* `500 Internal Server Error`: MongoDB conflict (case-sensitive DB name issues)

---

## Login API

### Endpoint

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

### What does it do?

Checks email + password and returns a JWT token if valid.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "email": "bhakti@example.com",
  "password": "secure123"
}
```

### What’s happening internally?

* Retrieves user by email
* Validates password using BCrypt’s `.matches()` method
* On success, generates a JWT token (valid for certain time period)

### Response (Success)

```json
{
  "token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
}
```

### Common Errors

* `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid password or email
* `500 Internal`: User not found or DB issue

---

## JWT Token - What & Why

* JWT stands for **JSON Web Token**.
* It’s a secure token that proves the user is logged in.
* Sent in HTTP headers to access protected routes (e.g. posting a job).

JWT structure: `header.payload.signature`

* Token includes user info (like `userId`) but never the password.

---

## JWT Authentication System
- JWT created using `io.jsonwebtoken`.
- `JWTService.java` is added to:
     - Create token using email
     - Validate and extract email from token
- JWT is added in `Authorization` header as:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token_here>
```
## JwtFilter and Spring Security Integration
- `JWTFilter.java` is created to intercept every request.
- It validated tokens, extracts user, and sets Spring Security context.
- `SecurityConfig.java` now uses `JwtFilter`instead of default login.
- `UserDetailsService` is implemented via `CustomUserDetailsService.java`. 
- It loads user by email form MongoDB.
- Then wraps user into `CustomUserDetails` with role-based authorities.

## MongoDB Case Sensitivity Warning

> MongoDB treats `FreelanceSphere` and `freelancesphere` as **two different databases**.

**Fix**: Make sure your connection string and Spring Boot configuration match exactly in case:

```yaml
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      database: FreelanceSphere
```

---

## Security Configurations (Spring Security)

* `/api/auth/**` is public (does not require login)
* All other APIs are protected (require valid JWT)
* Uses filter to extract token from headers and validate it

---

## Repository Layer

File: `UserRepository.java`

```java
public interface UserRepository extends MongoRepository<User, String> {
    Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);
    Boolean existsByEmail(String email);
}
```

Used for:

* Finding user during login
* Checking duplicate email during registration

## Troubleshooting Tips

| Problem                  | Reason                              | Fix                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 405 METHOD\_NOT\_ALLOWED | Sending GET instead of POST         | Use Postman or frontend to send POST                           |
| 409 Conflict             | Duplicate email or DB case mismatch | Check MongoDB & Spring config                                  |
| Password doesn't match   | Password was not hashed on save     | Make sure register route uses `BCryptPasswordEncoder.encode()` |
| JWT token not generated  | Login logic failed                  | Ensure `BCrypt.matches()` is used + JWT is returned            |

## User Registration and Login Validation
- `UserRegistrationRequest.java`is created as a separate DTO (Data Transfer Object) for user registration.
- Validation is added using `@NotBlank` and `@Email` annotations.
- Passwords are hashed using **BCrypt**.
- Users are assigned a `Role` (e.g., FREELANCER, ADMIN, etc).

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- `Role.java` enum (FREELANCER, CLIENT, ADMIN) is added.
- `@PreAuthorize` checks are added on controller methods.
- Only users with specific roles can access:
   - `/api/auth/admin/dashboard` -> only `ADMIN`
   - `/api/auth/freelancer/dashboard` -> only `FREELANCER`
- `@EnableMethodSecurity` is used.
- Role is stored in MongoDB and converted to `ROLE_` prefix using `CustomUserDetails.java`.


## Future Improvements

* Refresh tokens
* Logout functionality
* Email verification / OTP
* Swagger UI / OpenAPI docs
